This app was created for a specific Brazilian jiu-jitsu club and meets the club’s specific requirements. These include creating different training groups and assigning training schedules to them, as well as creating member profiles with additional information such as group, tariff type, belt, and achievements.

There are three different user roles, each with its own functionality: admin, coach, and member. The admin can manage the training schedule and member information. Logged-in users can view all club members and their achievements and filter the schedule by their group. A coach can be assigned to conduct a specific class (event) or a training session (schedule).
To check admin functionality it needs to log in with credentials: username admin@mail.com, password: password.
